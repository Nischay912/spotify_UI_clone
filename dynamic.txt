Now, we want to load the albums and their informations too dynamically in the playlist , when we add it in the folder of "songs" .

So, we need to : form a json file (JAVASCRIPT OBJECT NOTATION FILE) containing the information of it : so lets see the "info.json" file now in the cs , ncs folders we have.

they are like JAVASCRIPT OBJECT with syntax as --
{ 
    "key1":"value1",
    "key2":"value2",
    .....so on
}

So, this will be used in the info.json file there now in the album folders cs , ncs and so on....
